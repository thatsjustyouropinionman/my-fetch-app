My Fetch Posts App

Summary
I began with updating node and installing the necessary packages to use apollo in the project.

I played around a bit with the graphql playground, to get an idea of the structure of the data.

I ran into the particular issue of not being able to see how the date of posts was stored. I knew this would pose issues later but continued, hoping I'd figure it out along the way.

My React was a little rusty at first, but came back to me soon enough. I have never used GraphQL or Apollo before and the use of these proved the greater challenge. There was some helpful tutorials and documentation (in particular https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/ and https://flaviocopes.com/apollo/#introduction-to-apollo)

I was able to acheive requesting allPosts from the server and print some relevant fields to the UI. I also decided to include some returns from an allProducts request, because I found the product names highly entertaining (who wouldn't want a 'Gorgeous Concrete Car'?!).

This was as much progress as I was able to make in the given time. I was disappointed to not get to the stage of visualising the number of posts, as the vx components were very visually appealing! Had I been able to understand how to determine when a post was created perhaps I would have got closer to acheiving this.

Overall, though the finished product was not what I had hoped to acheive in the time frame, I was proud of my progress and enjoyed the process of learning about a new APIs and refreshing my React knowledge.
